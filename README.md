<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Here is my Mission 0 for LV5 Advanced Software Developement. I pretty much thought about car listing websites as soon as I read listing site. It is simple but there are still things that I need to work on like responsiveness, nesting in scss, relocating the search bar as UX designer has mentioned and using React. However, transitioning into React wouldn't be an issue.
